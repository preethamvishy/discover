# Discover

Discover new music, tap to the latest hot beats or end up listening to a song that you haven't heard in a while. DISCOVER is an Angular 4 project that plays random songs from your favourite online service. DISCOVER currently supports YouTube but the project is under active development.


## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.
